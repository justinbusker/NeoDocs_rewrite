# NeoDocs

## What is NeoDocs
NeoDocs is a docs-like document editor built to be fast and allow quick movement between documents using some terminal-based ideas that I tend to use very regularly.

## My Goals for NeoDocs
My goals for this project are ultimately leading towards a document editor that I could actually use to take notes and quickly access documents that may be buried deep. I tend to have a bad case of not following a consistent naming convention for documents at school, this leads to me having to do multiple searches through my drive to eventually find the document that I am actively working on. While actively working on an assignment that is due soon, I find myself remembering what I wrote in the actual body of the document rather than the title that I set it as, so having a search similar to grep in NeoVim would be awesome. I also tend to have to split my screen a lot working on post labs for my ECEN classes, needing to look at my pre-lab to compare values.

With these notes, the main features I want to complete are:
- grep-like search through the body's of documents
- screen splitting multiple (probably for now just two) documents at once
- Live file sharing with other users
- Keybindings to help aid a mouseless navigation, so your hands never leave your keyboard
